<h1>The Best Movies According to Martin</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<h3>Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels</h3>
<p>A gritty british film by Guy Ritchie that depicts the stories of several sets of characters. All the characters stories intertwine without them realising.</p>
<h3>John Wick - Quadrilogy</h3>
<p>An assasin is brought out of retirement when his wife dies, venturing on a vendeta led journey for justice.</p>
<h3>The Green Mile</h3>
<p>A film about a death row inmate and his guards. Very well shot movie and very emotional.</p>
<h3>Man on Fire</h3>
<p>Denzel Washington is a bodyguard hired by a family in Mexico to protect their daughter. Powerful film.</p>
